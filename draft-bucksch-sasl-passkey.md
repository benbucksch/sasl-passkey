# Introduction

Introduces a SASL mechanism that allows the user to authenticate using a FIDO2 Passkey.

The client/server exchange is a simple challenge-response mechanism,
using the same mechanism that browsers use when they authenticate
using Passkeys to a website.

# Creation of the Passkey

The Passkey has to be created on the user's device via other means.
Signup and passkey creation happens, for example, at the normal
web frontend of the site.

We assume that the browser will use the same authenticator (OS functions) as the authenticating application. The authenticator
is responsible for creating and storing the Passkey. The
authenticator may also sync the Passkey between the user's devices.
The Passkey is never seen by either browser nor the authenticating
application, but managed entirely by the Passkey manager.

## Initial Auth using Passkey

1. The authenticating application has the target server hostname and
   authentication identity (e.g. username or email address) configured.  If the
target server is an IMAP server, the username is the email address. If the
target server is an XMPP server, the username is the XMPP address of the user.

2. The authenticating application opens (or reuses existing) connection to the
   target server and starts authentication using the SASL `PASSKEY` mechanism.
`PASSKEY` mechanism starts with the client sending the initial client response,
which has the following format defined using ABNF:

~~~~ abnf
passkey-client-step1 = authentication_id
authentication_id    = 1*OCTET
~~~~

3.
  a. The server generates a Passkey challenge, based on the
  target server hostname, authentication identity, and Passkey of the user,
  and sends the server challenge with to the client.

  b. If login for that user is forbidden, the server will return a
  SASL error. A human-readable error message for end users
  must be included, with a detailed and helpful description of why
  login is forbidden for that user, and instructions for the user
  how the situation can be remedied.

4.
The authenticating application takes the challenge and passes it
on as-is to the OS authenticator API, which returns the response.
The OS calls are the same that the web browser would do.

As part of this process, the OS authenticator API may require
the end user to complete additional authentication, for example
entering a device unlock code, providing a fingerprint,
face recognition, or similar. This is the responsibility of the
OS authenticator and outside the scope of this protocol.

The authenticating application then passes on the response
as-is to the server.

5.
  a. If the server accepts the response as valid and allows login,
  it responds with a SASL success response. The user is logged in.

  b. If the response is invalid, the server responds with a
  SASL error and a human-readable error message for the end user.

~~~~ abnf
server-final-message = server-error "," server-error-message
        ; Only returned on error. Omitted on success.

server-error = "e=" server-error-value

server-error-value = "invalid-encoding" /
                     "unknown-user" /
                     "invalid-username-encoding" /
                       ; invalid username encoding (invalid UTF-8 or
                       ; SASLprep failed)
                     "other-error" /
                     server-error-value-ext
        ; Unrecognized errors should be treated as "other-error".
        ; In order to prevent information disclosure, the server
        ; may substitute the real reason with "other-error".

server-error-value-ext = value
        ; Additional error reasons added by extensions
        ; to this document.

server-error-message = "m=" server-error-message-value

server-error-message-value = 1*OCTET
        ; Human readable error message in UTF-8
~~~~

This SASL mechanims will typically be combined with SASL chain
or SASL2, to allow re-opening a new connection without requiring
the user to go through Passkey authentication again.

# IMAP Example

In IMAP, the exchange would be:

~~~~
S: * OK ACME IMAP Server v1.23 is ready
C: 22 CAPABILITY
S: 22 CAPABILITY IMAP4rev1 IMAP4rev2 AUTH=PASSKEY AUTH=REMEMBERME
C: 23 AUTHENTICATE PASSKEY eW91QGV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg==
S: AEC6576576557=== (passkey challenge)
C: EAB675757GJvYgB== (passkey response)
S: 23 OK AUTHENTICATE completed
~~~~

Where "eW91QGV4YW1wbGUuY29tCg==" is base64-encoded authentication identity
("you@example.com"), "AEC6576576557===" is base64-encoded passkey challenge,
"EAB675757GJvYgB==" is base64-encoded passkey response.  All challenge and
responses values are base64-encoded according to the IMAP SASL protocol
profile.
